  <p> ZeroCostCloset recognizes the profound impact of food scarcity in various countries. When people lack consistent
    access to essential food items, it's not just about the physical sensation of hunger; it's a challenge that
    reverberates through every facet of their lives.

    For one, malnutrition becomes a significant concern. Without the necessary nutrients, both children and adults face
    health issues. Children, in particular, may suffer developmental delays both mentally and physically. This lack of
    proper nutrition can lead to chronic health problems and diseases, which further exacerbate the individual's and
    community's challenges.

    Additionally, the constant search for food can take precedence over other essential activities like seeking
    education or employment. As a result, the cycle of poverty continues, with future generations inheriting the same
    struggles. Education, in particular, can take a backseat as children might be pulled out of schools to help their
    families find or afford food due to poverty, further limiting their future opportunities and prospects in life.

  <h4>
    There's a huge global food crisis right now, the worst since 1963. Many reasons, like wars, climate change, and high
    food prices, are making millions more hungry every day. Around 350 million people are extremely hungry, and almost
    49 million are near famine levels. This hunger affects kids, adults, and whole communities. Malnourished moms have
    malnourished babies, and hunger continues across generations. This situation makes kids unhealthy, farmers struggle,
    and entire towns move looking for food.</h4>

    <h2 class="header-item">What is the GRFC?</h2>
    <p>The GRFC 2023 is a collaborative effort among 16
      partners to achieve an independent and consensusbased assessment of acute food insecurity that
      informs humanitarian and development action.
      Published by the Food Security Information Network
      (FSIN) in support of the Global Network against
      Food Crises (GNAFC), the GRFC is the reference
      document on global, regional and country-level
      acute food insecurity in 2022. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The Global Report on Food Crises 2023 estimates that over a quarter of a billion people
      were acutely food-insecure and required urgent food assistance in 58 food-crisis countries/
      territories in 2022. This is the highest number in the seven-year history of the GRFC.</p>

    <h2>Number of people in GRFC countries/territories facing acute food insecurity, 2016‚Äì2022</h2>
    <img src="img/data2.png" width=560px alt="Global food crisis 2016-2022" />
    <p>Nearly 258 million people in 58 countries/territories were
      in Crisis or worse acute food insecurity (IPC/CH Phase
      3 or above, or equivalent) in 2022 ‚Äì up from 193 million
      in 53 countries/territories in 2021. As the graph (top
      right) shows, while there has been an increase in the
      population analysed, this is the highest on record since
      the GRFC started reporting these data in 2017. This
      marks the fourth consecutive year of rising numbers of
      people in IPC/CH Phase 3 or above or equivalent due to
      persistently high numbers in some countries, worsening
      situations in others, as well as increased analysis.</p>

    <h3>What is the global food crisis?</h3>
    <p> A global food crisis is when there isn't enough food for everyone around the world. This can happen for many
      reasons, like bad weather damaging crops, wars stopping food from being transported, or prices going up so much
      that
      people can't afford to buy food. When this happens, many people go hungry, and it can lead to other problems like
      poor health, conflicts, and people having to leave their homes to find food or better living conditions. </p>

    <img src="img/data3.png" width=560px alt="cases of global food crisis" />
    <h3>What caused the Global Food Crisis?</h3>
    <p>Wars, climate change, and rising expenses are causing a big food problem worldwide. Wars damage infrastructure
      and
      make goods expensive, which leads to hunger. Hunger can then cause more disputes and protests. Extreme weather
      events, which are happening more often, harm farming and increase hunger. In 2021, bad weather caused severe
      hunger
      in eight African countries, affecting 23.5 million people. The U.N. World Food Programme helps by giving immediate
      food aid and working on long-term solutions to these problems.</p>
